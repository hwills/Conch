Morgan's Notes:

"INTERNAL COMMANDS" will probably involve changing the same functions/files regardless of how well
we think we've organized our file, so those should be attempted by the same people/pair.

"PIPES" right now works by appending the output of the prevoius program to the tex specifying the
next program.  E.g.: "-f file.sh | set foo" will take the output generated by "-f file.sh" and append
that to the command on its right, creating "set foo [file output]".  If you can think of cases where
this solution fails, PLEASE speak up.  Changes to the behavior of pipes might have far reaching
implications, and it would be best if we could catch any potential problems early.
